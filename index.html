            <h1>MY FIRST WEBSITE! I guess...</h1> 
            <div>
                <p>Hey Guys! This is my first web page, Hope the heading is good enough!?</p>

                <p>I just started learning web programming from CS50. It's actully fun 
                making website, considering i haven't started how to use python in 
                web programming, yeah man it sure is fun. </p>
                
                <p>There is a thing that just wouldn't work for some reason:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Text Formatting</p></li>
                        <img src="imm/text-formatting.png" alt="HTML Formatting Elements">
                    </ul>
                <p>For some reason the HTML's Formatting elements(the list above) isn't working.</p>
                 
                <p>Maybe because I played arrount with FontWeight I don't know but even after deleting
                    that line the Formatting Element just wouldn't work. <br> I guess I will be using 
                    this website to learn Web programming.
                </p>
