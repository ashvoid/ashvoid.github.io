                        Deoghar is a Hindu word and the literal meaning of <b><i>'Deoghar'</i></b> is God ('dev')
                        and residence ('ghar') which basically means <b><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Gods 
                        Residence</i></b> or <b><i style="text-decoration: underline;">House of Gods</i></b>. 
                        Deoghar is also known as “Baidyanath Dham”, “Baba Dham”, “B. Deoghar”. The origin of 
                        Baidyanathdham is lost in time. The name Deoghar probably dates form the elevation of 
                        Great temple of Lord Baidyanath. Although The name of the builder of the temple seems to be not 
                        traceable certain portion of the temple is said to have been built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/
